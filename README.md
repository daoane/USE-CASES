## Collected use cases 
Until the M18 of the EPOS-IP project (March 2017) the [use cases from TCS](https://github.com/jan-michalek/USE-CASES/blob/master/EPOS-IP-WP06-Deliverable-D6.4-UseCases-20170328-Appendix-1.pdf) were collected and published as appendix in D6.4-M30.

ICS then reviewed all the individual TCS use cases and prepared two comperhensive use cases:
* [Simple Use Case for GUI](https://github.com/jan-michalek/USE-CASES/blob/master/Simple%20Use%20Case%20for%20GUI.docx)
* [Complex Use Case for GUI](https://github.com/jan-michalek/USE-CASES/blob/master/Complex%20Use%20Case%20for%20GUI.docx)

## New TCS use cases 
During the EPOS-IP WS in Barcelona (Oct 2018) the selected people from TCS were asked to provide new use cases which will be analyzed together with ICS and specific requirements for further development of GUI will be derived from them. This should be finished within Dec 2018.
